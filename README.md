# OctoPrint-PCA9685LEDStripControl

OctoPrint plugin that intercepts M150 GCode commands and controls LEDs connected to PCA9685 over I2C. Forked to add support to connect 
to a desktop PC through I2C on an FT232H. Also updated the code to work with newer releases of Octoprint. This does not work in python 2 at all. Tested on Python 3.10 and higher.

Implements the M150 command syntax from the latest Marlin.

        M150: Set Status LED Color - Use R-U-B for R-G-B Optional (W)
        M150 R255       ; Turn LED red
        M150 R255 U127  ; Turn LED orange (PWM only)
        M150            ; Turn LED off
        M150 R U B      ; Turn LED white
        M150 W          ; Turn LED white if using RGBW strips (optional)
